// Functions inline

// Inline functions are defined in the same file as the code that uses them
// and are typically used for small, simple functions that are not reused elsewhere in the code.

const double = fn(x) => x * 2; // Inline function to double a number

println(double(2)); // 4

// Multi line functions also allowed to pass to other functions, etc.
const add = fn (x, y) {
    return x + y; // Return the sum
};

println(add(2, 3)); // 5
