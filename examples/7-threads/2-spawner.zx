// Thread spawner

use thread;

// Zx allows us to create a custom spawner for threads.
// This is useful if we want to control how many threads are created.

const spawner = thread.spawner(4); // create a spawner with a maximum of 4 async threads
                                   // this works like a pool of threads

for i in 8 {

thread.sleep(1000); // sleep for 1 second to allow the threads to finish
