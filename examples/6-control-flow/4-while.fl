// While

// Flare comes with a simple way to control the flow of your program using the `while` statement.
// The `while` statement allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true.

let x = 10;

while x > 0 {
     println(x); // prints 10 to 1
     x = x - 1; // decrement x by 1
}

println("Exit while loop"); // prints Exit while loop
